/*
 * Waveshare ESP32-S3 board profile.
 *
 * This file is the hardware description for the Waveshare ESP32-S3 based
 * Waveshare target. It is intentionally kept as a single, editable map of the
 * board: serial ports, I2C buses, 1-Wire probes, IO points, TFT wiring,
 * supervisor inputs, MQTT/Home Assistant sizing, and Ethernet wiring.
 *
 * When adapting the firmware to a modified board, change the values here
 * first. The rest of the application consumes this profile through BoardSpec.
 * Pin values are ESP32 GPIO numbers unless a comment explicitly says the value
 * is a logical channel. A value of -1 means "not connected" or "disabled".
 *
 * NVS behavior:
 *   BoardSpec values are not stored as a board object in NVS. Some modules copy
 *   selected board values into their own persistent configuration as boot
 *   defaults; those cases are called out below. When a value is marked
 *   "not stored in NVS", changing it requires editing this file and rebuilding
 *   the firmware.
